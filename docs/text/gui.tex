\section{GUI}
The GUI start by running command \texttt{python3 main.py} in the virtual enviroment.

\subsection{Login screen}
When the app is opened, the user is greeted by a login screen. The user can either login with an existing account if you used the app in the past as shown in Figure \ref{fig:login}
or create a new one wiht username and password as in Figure \ref{fig:reg}.

\subsection{Main window}
After the login the user will se the main application window.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{File selection}
Selecting file for transfer is done by the button \texttt{Choose a file to be sent} that is shown in Figure \ref{fig:main}. 
After pressing the button, the file selection window will open and user can select the file they want to send.

\subsubsection{User discovery and friend addition}
There are 2 ways to discorver users using the app. Either user can scan the whole network for the active apps that are running using \texttt{List Non friends in DB} button.

    \caption{Adding users to db by scanning the network}
    \label{fig:LNF}
\end{figure}
The other way is by using button \texttt{Scan IP}. User enters the address he wants to scan in the text field next to the button and then presses the button.

    \caption{Adding user to db by scanning given IP}
    \label{fig:scanIP}
\end{figure}

Adding friends is handled by pressing the button \texttt{Befriend this user} that we can see in Figure \ref{fig:LNF}.

\subsubsection{Listing of users}
There are 2 ways you can list users that user can interact with. Either list only those users who user added to their friend list or list all users in database.
For this there are 2 buttons shown on Figure \ref{fig:main}. Those are \texttt{List friends} and \texttt{List Non friends in DB} respectively.

\subsubsection{Listing queued files}
Files that cannot be sent immediately are queued and will be sent when the user is available. The user can see the list of queued files by pressing the button 
\texttt{List outgoing queue}.\\

\subsubsection{Friend selection}
Choosing a friend who will be the target of the file transfer is done by choosing one friend from the rolldown menu next to the \texttt{List friends} button.\\

\subsubsection{File sharing}
After selecting the file and the friend to send it to, the user can press the button \texttt{Send file} to send the file to the selected friend.
If the target is not available, the app will prompt the user with following message and put the file in the queue to be sent later.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/notAvailable.png}
    \caption{Target not available}
    \label{fig:notAvail}
\end{figure}

Recieving the file is done by the target user pressing the button \texttt{List incoming queue} which opens window with all files that are waiting to be
recieved. The user can either save or ignore a single file or accept all files in the queue.\\
